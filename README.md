Gate of Babylon is a mod for Fabric that adds in a bunch of new weapon/tool/armor options. It is currently in heavy beta. MIT license. 

I am looking for feedback on weapon balancing, new weapon ideas, and special ability suggestions. For more information on tools & stats, view the [wiki](https://github.com/Draylar/gate-of-babylon/wiki).
